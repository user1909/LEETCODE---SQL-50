SELECT p.product_id  , 
IFNULL(ROUND(SUM((p.price * u.Units))/SUM(u.units),2),0) AS 'average_price'
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON p.product_id = u.product_id
WHERE u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date 
AND p.end_date OR u.purchase_date is NULL
GROUP BY p.product_id

NOTE :
-----
WHERE u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_dat as it ensures that we're only considering units sold during the
time when the product had a valid price.

The "OR" means we're also interested in cases where there is no corresponding purchase date in the UnitsSold table.
This includes situations where a product didn't have any sales during the specified pricing period.
